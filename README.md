# This is Conway's Game of Life
Ever wondered what cells look like up close?

Sorry, but this web app won't satisfy your curiosity. These cells are strictly artificial and don't follow any laws of nature! They do, however, follow Conway's rules of his Game of Life.

## What is GOL?
Each cell can either be alive or dead in the sort-of "agar" they inhabit. Living ones are white, while dead ones are black.

Every generation, each cell follows these simple rules:
1) die if there are too many neighboring cells (4+)
2) die if I only have 1 neighbor
3) revive if there are exactly 3 neighboring cells
4) otherwise do nothing

## Can these rules be customized?
Yes, they can! This virtual simulation is ours and we can do whatever we want with it.

I plan to allow the user to customize the rules once they have beaten a second challenge. I might have to optimize the code (a lot!), but it's on the horizon.
