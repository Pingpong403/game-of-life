            <p>Conway's Game of Life is a simulation of a simple, microscopic ecosystem. This ecosystem consists of living and dead cells. Living cells appear in white, while dead cells appear in black.</p>
            <p>Living cells can die if they're suffocated (more than 3 neighbors) or lonely (less than 2). Dead cells can revive if they have exactly 3 neighbors (like reproduction).</p>
            <p>The game progresses in generations! The rules above apply to cells changing from one generation to the next.</p>
            <p>This puzzle is meant to simulate the importance of starting conditions. Your target is a nice, healthy ecosystem that maintains its mass and therefore lives on forever in harmony.</p>
            <p>This ecosystem currently has a tiny problem: it is missing a cell! This may seem trivial, but lacking a single cell is what's causing the ecosystem to eventually fail. Stagnation is death.</p>
            <p>Figure out where the single cell belongs. Once you do, you unlock full interactivity!</p>
